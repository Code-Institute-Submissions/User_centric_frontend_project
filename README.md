# The Monkees Band Website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a site for a music band (The Monkees). The site highlight a introduction
about the band in the landing page, about the band page, the band music audios,
some photos of the band, the band tour dates, and a page for events booking request
such as requests for weddings and christmas parties.

## UX
My aiming is to design an easy user interface for the sites band fans users. At the first
look at the site after landing, is to easily navigate throw the site by the hamburger
menu, to switch to another pages. Also, a paragraph to introduce the band, and a link to request to book the band for an events. At the top right, band logo, to come back to the landing page from different pages, just by one click.

Six pages, for the band fans to see more of the band. Scrolling down at the home page,
would show the fans and users a video of the band playing automatically, the band members.
Additionally, the page contain a section for the band music link. f Finally, at the footer of the page, three social media links of the band, Facebook, Youtube, and twitter.

## Technologies
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. bootstrap 4.1.3

##Features
The site has hamburger menu on all screen sizes, that's as the home page has most links
to other pages. Responsive, using mobile-first design.

## Testing
My goal is to provide for the fans and general users, a band site, where they can find usual information and media about the band. A soon the fan or user open the site, he / she can read useful
information about the band, and a link if they would like to book the band for an event. Easily to navigate to the other pages, either by hamburger menu or by scrolling down to home Page sections.

First section after the landing section, is a video of the band playing automatically with an option for the user to stop and control the video. The next section, is for the user to see the band members photos and names display, this separately will linked the user to the BIO of the band members in about us page directly. The final section is for the fans and site users to have a button which redirected to listen to the band music.

About us page has more information about the band, and BIO for each of the band members. Our music page, is for the fans to see two albums of the band and listen to 4 audios. Gallery page, is for the user to display more photos of the band.Tour dates, is for the band fans to see the upcoming dates for the bands, date and locations. Finally, the booking page, which allow the users to book the band for an events, if the user do not submit Name, Email, Location by providing city or country and the dates of the event plus to a message to the band, the form will not be submitted and will show an error, as those fields are required by adding required' attribute'.
