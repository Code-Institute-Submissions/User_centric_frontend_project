# The Monkees Band Website
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a site for a music band (The Monkees). The site highlight a introduction
about the band in the landing page, about the band page, the band music audios,
some photos of the band, the band tour dates, and a page for events booking request
such as requests for weddings and christmas parties.

## UX
My aiming is to design an easy user interface for the sites band fans users. At the first
look at the site after landing, is to easily navigate throw the site by the hamburger
menu, to switch to another pages. Also, a paragraph to introduce the band, and a link to request to book the band for an events. At the top right, band logo, to come back to the landing page from different pages, just by one click.

Six pages, for the band fans to see more of the band. Scrolling down at the home page,
would show the fans and the users, a video of the band playing automatically, and the band members.
Additionally, the page contain a section for the band music link. Finally, at the footer of the page, three social media links of the band, which are Facebook, Youtube, and twitter.

## UX Perspective
User stories, is another important part of the UX design. In this section, features will be written from website visitor and user perspective, as follow:

When I visit a site, I would like to have an idea of what is the site about, an easy way to navigate to around the site, and an easy efficient way to fill up any form. Additionally, I want to be able to have a solid idea about what services and resources are available by visiting the site.

 As a user visiting a musical band website, I would like to have a short idea about the band history, as the landing page open in my browser, and a navbar to easily navigate to other pages. when I start scrolling the home page, I want to have short information about the band, such as a video, band members, and the band latest album by a link to listen to their music. As a fan, I would like to visit the website, to listen to their music, and know their tour dates, so I can attend their upcoming events.

In addition, as a user I would like to have the website well designed cross multiple platforms, either I'm visiting the site via my mobile, or on my ipad, or checking the site on my laptop. Therefore, responsive design is essential.

The following link shows the initial mockups for The Monkees website using balsamiq 3: https://github.com/Tariqalrehily/User_centric_frontend_project/blob/master/TheMonkesdProjectMockups.pdf

## Technologies
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap 4.1.3

## Features
The site has hamburger menu on all screen sizes, that's as the home page has most links
to other pages. Responsive, using mobile-first design.

## Testing
My goal is to provide for the fans and general users, a band site, where they can find usual information and media about the band. A soon the fan or user open the site, he / she can read useful
information about the band, and a link if they would like to book the band for an event. Easily to navigate to the other pages, either by hamburger menu or by scrolling down the home Page sections.

First section after the landing section, is a video of the band playing automatically, with an option for the user to stop and control the video. The next section, is for the user to see the band members photos and names display, this will link to the about us page directly, by clicking on any of the band members. The final section is for the fans and site users to have a button which redirected to listen to the band music.

About us page has more information about the band, and BIO for each of the band members. Our music page, is for the fans to see two albums of the band and listen to 4 audios. Gallery page, is for the user to display more photos of the band.Tour dates, is for the band fans to see the upcoming dates for the bands, date and locations. Finally, the booking page, which allow the users to book the band for an events, if the user do not submit Name, Email, Location by providing city or country and the dates of the event plus a message to the band, the form will not be submitted and will show an error, as those fields are required by adding required' attribute'.
