              <p>The four actor-musicians were initially allowed only limited
                 roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their
                 five-year career as "the Monkees". This was due in part to the
                 amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless,
                 Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Tork
                 contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. All
                 four contributed lead vocals to various tracks. They eventually fought for
                 the right to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name,
                 acting as musicians, singers, songwriters and producers.

              <p>Following the television show's cancellation in 1968, the Monkees continued
                 to record music until 1971, after which the group broke up. A revival of interest
                 in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and
                 new records. The group has reunited and toured several times since then with
                 different line-ups and varying degrees of success. Jones died in February 2012
                 and Tork died in February 2019. Dolenz and Nesmith remain active members of the
                 group.
